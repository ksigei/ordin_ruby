# Booleans
True and False
# The Boolean values true and false represent exactly what you think they do: true represents something that is true, and false represents something that is false.

Nil
# In Ruby, nil represents “nothing”. Everything in Ruby has a return value. When a piece of code doesn’t have anything to return, it will return nil. This is pretty abstract, but it will make more sense as you learn and use Ruby more.
